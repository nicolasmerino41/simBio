# Bipartite model equations with MF

In this document we present a mean‐field (MF) formulation of a bipartite model describing the dynamics of herbivores and predators. The model incorporates intra‐guild competition among herbivores and predation interactions between herbivores and predators. Below, we detail the equations, explain each term, and show how equilibrium conditions relate to the dynamic formulation.

## Herbivore Dynamics

The dynamics of herbivore species \(i\) are described by the equation
$$
\frac{\dot{H_i}}{H_i} = r_i \left( 1 - \frac{(1-\mu)H_i + \mu\,H^{tot} + \nu\,P_i^{tot}}{K_i} \right).
$$

**Explanation:**

- **\(H_i\):** Biomass (or density) of herbivore species \(i\).

- **\(r_i\):** Intrinsic growth rate of species \(i\).

- **Competition Terms:**
  
  - \((1-\mu)H_i\) represents self-regulation.
  
  - \(\mu\,H^{tot}\) represents the effect of total herbivore biomass, where \(H^{tot} = \sum_j H_j\).

- **Predation Term:**
  
  - \(\nu\,P_i^{tot}\) captures the loss of herbivores due to predation.
  
  - \(P_i^{tot} = \sum_{\alpha \in \{\text{predators of }i\}} P_\alpha\) is the total biomass of predators feeding on species \(i\).

- **\(K_i\):** The carrying capacity of species \(i\) given by
  $$
  K_i = \frac{r_i}{d_i},
  $$
  with \(d_i\) as the self-regulation parameter.

- **Attack Rate Notation:**
  $$
  A_{i \alpha}^* = \frac{a_{i \alpha}}{d_i} \equiv \nu,
  $$
  meaning that under the mean‐field assumption the effective attack rate is approximated by a constant \(\nu\).

## Predator Dynamics

The dynamics for predator species \(\alpha\) are given by
$$
\frac{\dot{P_\alpha}}{P_\alpha} = m_\alpha \left(\frac{\epsilon \sum_{i} \left(\frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\right) \frac{d_i}{d_\alpha}H_i - P_\alpha}{K_\alpha} - 1\right).
$$

**Explanation:**

- **\(P_\alpha\):** Biomass (or density) of predator species \(\alpha\).

- **\(m_\alpha\):** Intrinsic mortality rate of predator \(\alpha\).

- **Scaling in the Gain Term:**
  
  - The factor \(\frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\) represents the raw predator–herbivore attack rate scaled by the herbivore’s self-regulation.
  
  - Multiplying by \(\frac{d_i}{d_\alpha}\) introduces a scaling factor \(\psi\):
    $$
    \psi = \frac{d_i}{d_\alpha}.
    $$
  
  - The raw conversion efficiency \(\epsilon\) is then scaled to yield the effective efficiency
    $$
    \varepsilon = \epsilon\,\psi.
    $$

- **Mean-field Approximation:**
  
  - Under a MF assumption, we approximate the summed gain term as
    $$
    \sum_i \left(\frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\right)\frac{d_i}{d_\alpha} H_i \approx \nu\,H_\alpha^{tot},
    $$
    where \(H_\alpha^{tot} = \sum_{i \in \{\text{prey of } \alpha\}} H_i\).
  
  - Thus, the predator equation simplifies to
    $$
    \frac{\dot{P_\alpha}}{P_\alpha} = m_\alpha \left(\frac{\varepsilon\,\nu\,H_\alpha^{tot} - P_\alpha}{K_\alpha} - 1\right).
    $$

- **\(K_\alpha\):** 
Defined dynamically as
  $$
  K_\alpha = \frac{m_\alpha}{d_\alpha},
  $$
  which represents the intrinsic balance between predator mortality and self-regulation.

## Equilibrium and Parameterisation

At equilibrium (\(\dot{P_\alpha}=0\)), we have
$$
\varepsilon\,\nu\,\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot} - \hat{P}_\alpha = \frac{m_\alpha}{d_\alpha} = K_\alpha.
$$
This shows that the equilibrium predator biomass \(\hat{P}_\alpha\) and the equilibrium total prey biomass \(\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot}\) are related through the effective parameters \(\varepsilon\) and \(\nu\).

**Predator Viability Condition:**
$$
\varepsilon\,\nu\,\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot} > \hat{P}_\alpha
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
\varepsilon\,\nu > \frac{\hat{P}_\alpha}{\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot}}.
$$

**Apparent Competition among Herbivores:**

When herbivores share predators, they indirectly affect each other’s dynamics (apparent competition). A simplified representation of this effect is given by:
$$
\varepsilon\,\nu^2\,N_{ij} + \mu,
$$
with the condition that
$$
\varepsilon\,\nu > \text{critical value of } N_{ij},
$$
where \(N_{ij}\) represents the number of shared predators between herbivore \(i\) and \(j\).

### Derived Equilibrium Expressions

For completeness, the following equilibrium expressions can be derived:

- For predators:
  $$
  K_\alpha = \varepsilon\,\nu\,\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot} - \hat{P}_\alpha.
  $$

- For herbivores:
  $$
  K_i = (1-\mu)\,\hat{H}_i - \nu\,\hat{P}_i^{tot} + \mu\,\hat{H}^{tot},
  $$
  where \(\hat{H}^{tot}\) is the total equilibrium herbivore biomass and \(\hat{P}_i^{tot}\) is the total equilibrium predation pressure on species \(i\).

## Other Insights on Perturbations

Small perturbations in biomass provide insight into the system’s sensitivity. For example, a small change in predator biomass is given by:
$$
\delta P_\alpha = \varepsilon\,\nu\,\sum_{j \leftrightsquigarrow \alpha} \delta H_j,
$$
and the change in total predator biomass affecting herbivore \(i\) is:
$$
\delta P_i^{tot} = \sum_{\alpha \leftrightsquigarrow i} \delta P_\alpha = \varepsilon\,\nu\,\sum_{j \leftrightsquigarrow \alpha \leftrightsquigarrow i} \delta H_j.
$$
Here, the notation \(j \leftrightsquigarrow \alpha \leftrightsquigarrow i\) indicates herbivores \(i\) and \(j\) that share common predators.

**Note:**  

- In this framework, \(\mu\) (competition strength) and \(\varepsilon\) (conversion efficiency) are treated as free parameters.  

- The parameter \(\nu\) consistently represents the effective predation rate: it appears in the herbivore equation as the loss rate and in the predator equation (multiplied by \(\varepsilon\)) as the gain rate, ensuring consistency across the model.
