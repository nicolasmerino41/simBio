In this document we present a mean‐field (MF) formulation of a bipartite model describing the dynamics of herbivores and predators. The model incorporates intra‐guild competition among herbivores and predation interactions between herbivores and predators.

# Herbivore dynamics

The dynamics of herbivore species \(i\) are described by the equation
$$
\frac{\dot{H_i}}{H_i} = r_i \left( 1 - \frac{(1-\mu)H_i + \mu\,H^{tot} + \nu\,P_i^{tot}}{K_i} \right)
$$

**Explanation:**

- **\(H_i\):** Biomass of herbivore species \(i\).

- **\(r_i\):** Intrinsic growth rate of species \(i\).

- **Competition terms:**
  
  - \((1-\mu)H_i\) represents self-regulation.
  
  - \(\mu\,H^{tot}\) represents the effect of total herbivore biomass, where \(H^{tot} = \sum_j H_j\).

- **Predation term:**
  
  - \(\nu\,P_i^{tot}\) captures the loss of herbivores due to predation.
  
  - \(P_i^{tot} = \sum_{\alpha \in \{\text{predators of }i\}} P_\alpha\) is the total biomass of predators feeding on species \(i\).

- **\(K_i\):** The carrying capacity of species \(i\) given by
  $$
  K_i = \frac{r_i}{d_i}
  $$
  with \(d_i\) as the self-regulation parameter.

- **Attack rate notation:**
  $$
  A_{i \alpha}^* = \frac{a_{i \alpha}}{d_i} \equiv \nu
  $$
  meaning that under the mean‐field assumption the effective attack rate is approximated by a constant \(\nu\).

# Predator dynamics

The dynamics for predator species \(\alpha\) are given by
$$
\frac{\dot{P_\alpha}}{P_\alpha} = m_\alpha \left(\frac{\epsilon \sum_{i} \left(\frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\right) \frac{d_i}{d_\alpha}H_i - P_\alpha}{K_\alpha} - 1\right)
$$

**Explanation:**

- **\(P_\alpha\):** Biomass of predator species \(\alpha\).

- **\(m_\alpha\):** Intrinsic mortality rate of predator \(\alpha\).

- **Scaling in the gain term:**
  
  - The factor \(\frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\) represents the raw predator–herbivore attack rate scaled by the herbivore’s self-regulation.
  
  - Multiplying by \(\frac{d_i}{d_\alpha}\) introduces a scaling factor \(\psi\):
    $$
    \psi = \frac{d_i}{d_\alpha}
    $$
  
  - The raw conversion efficiency \(\epsilon\) is then scaled to yield the effective efficiency
    $$
    \varepsilon = \epsilon\,\psi
    $$

- **Mean-field approximation:**
  
  - Under a MF assumption, we approximate the summed gain term as
    $$
    \sum_i \left(\frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\right)\frac{d_i}{d_\alpha} H_i \approx \nu\,H_\alpha^{tot}
    $$
    where \(H_\alpha^{tot} = \sum_{i \in \{\text{prey of } \alpha\}} H_i\).
  
  - Thus, the predator equation simplifies to
    $$
    \frac{\dot{P_\alpha}}{P_\alpha} = m_\alpha \left(\frac{\varepsilon\,\nu\,H_\alpha^{tot} - P_\alpha}{K_\alpha} - 1\right)
    $$

- **\(K_\alpha\):** 
Defined dynamically as
  $$
  K_\alpha = \frac{m_\alpha}{d_\alpha}
  $$
  which represents the intrinsic balance between predator mortality and self-regulation.

# Equilibrium and parameterisation

At equilibrium (\(\dot{P_\alpha}=0\)), we have
$$
\varepsilon\,\nu\,\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot} - \hat{P}_\alpha = \frac{m_\alpha}{d_\alpha} = K_\alpha
$$
This shows that the equilibrium predator biomass \(\hat{P}_\alpha\) and the equilibrium total prey biomass \(\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot}\) are related through the effective parameters \(\varepsilon\) and \(\nu\).

**Predator viability condition:**
$$
\varepsilon\,\nu\,\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot} > \hat{P}_\alpha
\quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad
\varepsilon\,\nu > \frac{\hat{P}_\alpha}{\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot}}
$$

## Derived equilibrium expressions

For completeness, the following equilibrium expressions can be derived:

- For predators:
  $$
  K_\alpha = \varepsilon\,\nu\,\hat{H}_\alpha^{tot} - \hat{P}_\alpha
  $$

- For herbivores:
  $$
  K_i = (1-\mu)\,\hat{H}_i + \nu\,\hat{P}_i^{tot} + \mu\,\hat{H}^{tot}
  $$
  where \(\hat{H}^{tot}\) is the total equilibrium herbivore biomass and \(\hat{P}_i^{tot}\) is the total equilibrium predation pressure on species \(i\).

# Other insights on perturbations

Understanding how small changes in species biomass propagate through the community helps us assess the system’s sensitivity and stability.

## Perturbations in predator biomass

A small change in the biomass of herbivores that serve as prey for a predator \(\alpha\) leads to a change in that predator’s biomass. This is represented by:
$$
\delta P_\alpha = \varepsilon\,\nu\,\sum_{j \rightsquigarrow \alpha} \delta H_j
$$
where:

- \(\delta P_\alpha\) is the change in predator \(\alpha\)’s biomass.

- \(\varepsilon\) is the effective conversion efficiency.

- \(\nu\) is the effective predation rate.

- \(\sum_{j \rightsquigarrow \alpha}\) indicates summing over all herbivores \(j\) that are preyed upon by predator \(\alpha\).

### Total predator impact on a herbivore

Herbivore \(i\) experiences a change in the overall predation pressure, which is the sum of the changes in biomass of all its predators:
$$
\delta P_i^{\text{tot}} = \sum_{\alpha \rightsquigarrow i} \delta P_\alpha 
= \varepsilon\,\nu\,\sum_{j \rightsquigarrow \alpha \rightsquigarrow i} \delta H_j
$$
where:

- \(\delta P_i^{\text{tot}}\) is the aggregate change in predation affecting herbivore \(i\).

- \(j \rightsquigarrow \alpha \rightsquigarrow i\) indicates that herbivores \(i\) and \(j\) share one or more common predators.

### Change in herbivore carrying capacity

The carrying capacity \(K_i\) for herbivore \(i\) is modulated by both its own biomass and the predation pressure it experiences. A small perturbation yields:
$$
\delta K_i = (1-\mu)\,\delta H_i + \mu\,\delta H^{\text{tot}} + \nu\,\delta P_i^{\text{tot}}
$$
where:

- \((1-\mu)\,\delta H_i\) represents the direct self‐regulatory effect.

- \(\mu\,\delta H^{\text{tot}}\) captures the influence of the overall herbivore biomass (\(H^{\text{tot}} = \sum_j H_j\)).

- \(\nu\,\delta P_i^{\text{tot}}\) accounts for the effect of changes in predation pressure on species \(i\).

### Combined effects via apparent competition

Herbivores that share predators can indirectly affect each other’s dynamics (apparent competition). A linearized expression for the combined effect of a perturbation in herbivore \(j\) on herbivore \(i\) is:
$$
\delta K_i = (1-\mu)\,\delta H_i + \left(\varepsilon\,\nu^2\,N_{ij} + \mu\right)\,\delta H_j
$$
where:

- \(N_{ij}\) quantifies the number of shared predators between herbivores \(i\) and \(j\).

- \(\varepsilon\,\nu^2\,N_{ij}\,\delta H_j\) represents the indirect effect transmitted through the predator dynamics.

- \(\mu\,\delta H_j\) reflects the direct competitive (mean‐field) impact of herbivore \(j\) on \(i\).

## Ecosystem functioning contributions

To evaluate a species' contribution to an ecosystem function \(\phi\), we consider both its direct effect and the indirect impact of its abundance:

1. **Direct and indirect contributions:**
   $$
   \Delta \phi_i = \phi_i + \phi_{/i}\,\bar{a}_i N_i,
   $$
   where:

   - \(\phi_i\) is the direct contribution.

   - \(\phi_{/i}\) is the function value without species \(i\).

   - \(\bar{a}_i N_i\) scales the indirect effect via species abundance.
2. **Alternate expression:**
   $$
   \Delta \phi_i = \phi - \phi_{/i},
   $$
   which directly quantifies the loss in ecosystem function due to species \(i\)'s removal.
3. **Normalized change:**
   Rearranging gives:
   $$
   \frac{\Delta \phi_i}{\phi} = \frac{\frac{\phi_i}{\phi} + \bar{a}_i N_i}{1 + \bar{a}_i N_i}.
   $$
   This normalized form facilitates comparisons across species with differing abundances and interaction strengths.
