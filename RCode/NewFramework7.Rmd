# A Generalized Framework for Trophic Dynamics

We present a generalized formulation of a model describing the dynamics of ecological communities composed of herbivores and predators. Unlike our earlier mean‐field (MF) approach, here we merge all trophic interactions into a single matrix \(A\). In addition, we include a competition matrix \(C\) (of size \(S \times S\)) that captures intra‐guild competition among herbivores. This formulation allows us for departures from the MF scenario by randomizing the interaction strengths around a given mean.

## Trophic Interactions

Let \(X\) be the vector of biomasses for all species, with the first \(S\) entries corresponding to the herbivore compartment (including both pure herbivores and omnivores) and the remaining \(R\) entries corresponding to predators.

- **Merged Trophic Interaction Matrix (\(A\))**  
  \(A\) is an \((S+R) \times (S+R)\) matrix. Each entry \(A_{ij}\) represents the net effect (per unit biomass) that species \(j\) exerts on species \(i\) via trophic interactions. Positive values indicate beneficial effects (e.g., energy gains through predation or omnivory), and negative values indicate detrimental effects (e.g., losses from being preyed upon). Importantly, each entry is given by:
  \[
  A_{ij} = \frac{a_{ij}}{d_i},
  \]
  where \(a_{ij}\) is the raw interaction strength and \(d_i\) is the self‐regulation parameter for species \(i\). This scaling ensures that the intrinsic self‐regulation of species \(i\) is factored into its net response.

- **Competition Matrix (\(C\))**  
  \(C\) is an \(S \times S\) matrix that affects only the herbivore compartment. The entries \(C_{ij}\) represent the competitive impact of species \(j\) on species \(i\) and are scaled as:
  \[
  C_{ij} = \frac{c_{ij}}{d_i},
  \]
  where \(c_{ij}\) is the raw competition coefficient.

## Model Equations

With this formulation, the trophic effects are entirely captured by the matrix \(A\) and competition by \(C\). For now, we assume that the self‐regulation parameter \(d_i\) is normalized to 1.

### Herbivore (and Omnivore) Dynamics

For each herbivore (or omnivore) species \(i\) (\(1 \leq i \leq S\)), the dynamics are given by

\[
\frac{\dot{H}_i}{H_i} = r_i \left( 1 - \frac{H_i + \sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{ij} X_j + \sum_{j=1}^{S} C_{ij} H_j}{K_i} \right),
\]

where:

- \(H_i\) is the biomass of species \(i\).
- \(r_i\) is its intrinsic growth rate.
- \(X_j\) denotes the biomass of species \(j\) (with \(X = [H_1,\dots,H_S,\,P_1,\dots,P_R]\)).
- \(K_i\) is the carrying capacity for species \(i\) (typically \(K_i = \frac{r_i}{d_i}\), and here \(d_i = 1\)).
- The term \(H_i\) represents intrinsic self‐regulation.
- The summation \(\sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{ij} X_j\) accounts for all trophic interactions (both beneficial and detrimental) on species \(i\).
- The summation \(\sum_{j=1}^{S} C_{ij} H_j\) represents competitive interactions among herbivores.

### Predator Dynamics

For each predator species \(\alpha\) (\(S+1 \leq \alpha \leq S+R\)), the dynamics are modeled by

\[
\frac{\dot{P}_\alpha}{P_\alpha} = m_\alpha \left( \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{\alpha j} X_j - P_\alpha}{K_\alpha} - 1 \right),
\]

where:

- \(P_\alpha\) is the biomass of predator \(\alpha\).
- \(m_\alpha\) is its intrinsic mortality rate.
- The term \(\sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{\alpha j} X_j\) represents the net trophic gain from all interactions.
- \(K_\alpha\) is the carrying capacity for predator \(\alpha\) (typically \(K_\alpha = \frac{m_\alpha}{d_\alpha}\)).

## Equilibrium Conditions and Viability

At equilibrium (\(\dot{H}_i = 0\) and \(\dot{P}_\alpha = 0\)), the biomass levels satisfy:

- **Herbivores (including omnivores):**
  \[
  K_i = H_i + \sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{ij} X_j + \sum_{j=1}^{S} C_{ij} H_j.
  \]
  
- **Predators:**
  \[
  K_\alpha = \sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{\alpha j} X_j - P_\alpha.
  \]

For predators, viability requires that the net trophic gain exceeds the predator’s own biomass:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{S+R} A_{\alpha j} X_j > P_\alpha.
\]

---

This generalized framework now incorporates the scaling of interaction strengths by the self‐regulation parameters, and it merges all trophic interactions into one matrix \(A\) while keeping a separate competition matrix \(C\) for herbivores. This setup allows us to explore deviations from the MF scenario by randomizing interaction strengths and to analyze the stability and dynamics of the system under more general conditions.


## Perturbation and Sensitivity

To assess stability, we linearize the system around the equilibrium:

\[
\delta \dot{X} = J\,\delta X,
\]

where \(J\) is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at equilibrium. From \(J\) we derive:

- **Resilience:** The maximum real part of \(J\)’s eigenvalues.
- **Reactivity:** Computed from the symmetric part of \(J\).
- **Persistence:** The fraction of species remaining above a threshold after a perturbation.

Additionally, elasticity analysis (e.g., \(E_{x,p} = \frac{\partial \ln x^*}{\partial \ln p}\)) quantifies the sensitivity of equilibrium biomasses to parameter changes.

## Ecosystem Functioning Contributions

Species contributions to an ecosystem function \(\phi\) (e.g., total biomass) are assessed via:

1. **Direct and Indirect Contributions:**
   \[
   \Delta \phi_i = \phi_i + \phi_{/i}\,\bar{a}_i N_i,
   \]
   where \(\phi_i\) is the direct contribution and \(\bar{a}_i N_i\) scales the network‐mediated (indirect) effects.

2. **Removal Impact:**
   \[
   \Delta \phi_i = \phi - \phi_{/i},
   \]
   which can be normalized for comparison:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta \phi_i}{\phi} = \frac{\frac{\phi_i}{\phi} + \bar{a}_i N_i}{1 + \bar{a}_i N_i}.
   \]

## Summary

In this generalized framework, we merge all trophic interactions into a single matrix \(A\) (of size \((S+R) \times (S+R)\)) while keeping a separate competition matrix \(C\) (of size \(S \times S\)) to account for intra-guild competition among herbivores. This formulation allows us to:
- Explore deviations from the mean‐field scenario by randomizing interaction strengths around a given mean.
- Allow for unconventional interactions (e.g., herbivores consuming predators) if they are present in \(A\).
- Analyze stability (resilience, reactivity, persistence) and species sensitivity (elasticities) under a more general set of conditions.
- Ultimately, compare theoretical predictions (from abstract, synthetic communities) with patterns observed in real communities.

This framework provides the foundation for our simulation pipelines and subsequent analyses linking community structure to ecosystem functioning.
