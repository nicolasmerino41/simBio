## Other Insights

Small perturbations in species biomass provide a window into the system’s sensitivity and overall stability. In our model, perturbations reveal both direct self‐effects and indirect effects mediated by shared predators. Here, we break down these effects.

## Apparent Competition and Perturbation Effects

**Perturbation in Predator Biomass:**  
A small change in the biomass of herbivores that serve as prey for predator \(\alpha\) leads to:
$$
\delta P_\alpha = \varepsilon\,\nu\,\sum_{j \rightsquigarrow \alpha} \delta H_j,
$$
where the arrow \(\rightsquigarrow\) denotes that the summation is over all herbivores \(j\) that are preyed upon by \(\alpha\).

**Total Predation Impact on Herbivores:**  
The net change in predation pressure on herbivore \(i\) is:
$$
\delta P_i^{\text{tot}} = \sum_{\alpha \rightsquigarrow i} \delta P_\alpha 
= \varepsilon\,\nu\,\sum_{j \rightsquigarrow \alpha \rightsquigarrow i} \delta H_j,
$$
indicating that herbivores sharing predators indirectly affect each other.

**Change in Herbivore Carrying Capacity:**  
The carrying capacity \(K_i\) of herbivore \(i\) is influenced by its own biomass and the predation pressure it experiences:
$$
\delta K_i = (1-\mu)\,\delta H_i + \mu\,\delta H^{\text{tot}} + \nu\,\delta P_i^{\text{tot}},
$$
where:

- \((1-\mu)\,\delta H_i\) is the direct self-regulatory effect.

- \(\mu\,\delta H^{\text{tot}}\) reflects the competitive impact from the total herbivore biomass.

- \(\nu\,\delta P_i^{\text{tot}}\) captures the influence of changes in predation.

**Combined Effect via Apparent Competition:**  
When herbivores share predators, they experience both direct competitive effects and indirect effects through the predators. A linearized representation of the combined impact on herbivore \(i\) due to a change in herbivore \(j\) is:
$$
(1-\mu)\,\delta H_i + \left(\varepsilon\,\nu^2\,N_{ij} + \mu\right)\,\delta H_j,
$$
where:

- \(N_{ij}\) quantifies the strength (or number) of shared predators between \(i\) and \(j\).

- \(\varepsilon\,\nu^2\,N_{ij}\,\delta H_j\) represents the indirect impact via shared predation.

- \(\mu\,\delta H_j\) accounts for the direct mean-field competitive effect.

## Ecosystem Functioning Contributions

To evaluate a species' contribution to an ecosystem function \(\phi\), we consider both its direct effect and the indirect impact of its abundance:

1. **Direct and Indirect Contributions:**
   $$
   \Delta \phi_i = \phi_i + \phi_{/i}\,\bar{a}_i N_i,
   $$
   where:

   - \(\phi_i\) is the direct contribution.

   - \(\phi_{/i}\) is the function value without species \(i\).

   - \(\bar{a}_i N_i\) scales the indirect effect via species abundance.
2. **Alternate Expression:**
   $$
   \Delta \phi_i = \phi - \phi_{/i},
   $$
   which directly quantifies the loss in ecosystem function due to species \(i\)'s removal.
3. **Normalized Change:**
   Rearranging gives:
   $$
   \frac{\Delta \phi_i}{\phi} = \frac{\frac{\phi_i}{\phi} + \bar{a}_i N_i}{1 + \bar{a}_i N_i}.
   $$
   This normalized form facilitates comparisons across species with differing abundances and interaction strengths.

## Implications

- **Direct effects:**  
  Each species is subject to self-regulation, captured by \((1-\mu)\,\delta H_i\).

- **Indirect Effects via Shared Predators:**  
  Herbivores can influence one another through the predators they share. The strength of these effects is modulated by \(\varepsilon\,\nu^2\) and the shared interaction coefficient \(N_{ij}\).

- **Composite Impact on Ecosystem Function:**  
  Combining direct contributions and indirect interactions yields a comprehensive measure of a species’ role in ecosystem functioning. This framework helps in identifying keystone species and understanding community resilience.

- **Stability and Sensitivity Analysis:**  
  Analyzing these perturbation terms enables us to identify critical thresholds. If a small perturbation in a species’ biomass leads to large changes in \(K_i\) or the overall ecosystem function, the system may be near a tipping point.

## Pipeline

1. **Perform local sensitivity analysis:**  
   Calculate the Jacobian at equilibrium to understand the response of each species to small perturbations. Identify key species whose perturbations lead to significant changes in overall dynamics.

2. **Global sensitivity and bifurcation analysis:**  
   Vary key parameters (such as \(\mu\), \(\nu\), \(d_i\), \(d_\alpha\), and \(\varepsilon\)) over realistic ranges to see how equilibrium states and stability change. Identify parameter thresholds for bifurcations.

3. **Ecosystem function contribution experiments:**  
   Simulate species removals and calculate \(\Delta \phi_i\) for different ecosystem functions (e.g., productivity, nutrient cycling). Compare the normalized contributions to identify keystone species.

4. **Integrate perturbation and function analyses:**  
   Relate the sensitivity (from perturbation analysis) to the changes in ecosystem function upon species removal. This integrated approach can reveal how the stability of the network influences overall ecosystem performance.
