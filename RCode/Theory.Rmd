# Theory
Given the equation:
$$ \frac{1}{X_i}\frac{dX_i}{dt} = r_i - d_i X_i + \sum_{i\neq j}^{N} \alpha_{ij}X_j $$
Or its equivalent:
$$  \frac{dX_i}{dt} = \left(d_i \left( K_i - X_i + \sum_{i\neq j}^{N} \frac{\alpha_{ij}}{d_i}X_j \right)\right)X_i $$

Where, growth is expressed as:
$$ r_i = d_i·K_i $$
Carrying capacity can be understood as the suitability/success of a species under some given conditions. This can be related to the niche of the species. Hence, we can express cc as the niche, where 1 would be optimum conditions (max K possible under this framework).

This approach ensures unit comparability between cells. However, the difference in productivity across cells causes cc to be different across cells in terms of absolute values. Thus, we need to establish the following equality:
$$ \hat{K}_i(z) = \text{niche of species i in cell z} $$
$$  \sum_{i}^{N} \hat{K}_i(z) · \lambda(z) = \sum_{i}^{N}K_i(z) = npp $$
By making this assumption, we ensure that species biomass translates into real biomass values driven by productivity of each area.

As usual, interaction strength is defined as:

Where:
$$ \text{Predator: }\frac{\alpha_{ij}}{d_i}=A_{ij}\sim |N(0,\sigma)|\\ \text{Prey: } -A_{ij} \times \epsilon $$
This allow us to express **interaction strengths as a proportion against self-regulation (intra- vs interspecific effects)**.

*Notice this approach assumes that all species self-regulate with the same strength. We can try a relaxation of this assumption later on.*

Then, in order for the community to be stable, we need:
$$ \frac{dX_i}{dt} = 0$$
Which can be accomplished by:
$$d_i = 0$$ 
or
$$0= \left( K_i - X_i + \sum_{i\neq j}^{N} \frac{\alpha_{ij}}{d_i}X_j \right)$$
Which means that equilibrium densities can be found through:
$$0=K-X^*+A·X^*$$
$$X^*=K(I-A)^{-1}$$

# New Framework

## Resource Dynamics

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \text{NPP} - \sum_i c_i X_i$$

## Herbivore Dynamics

$$\frac{dH_i}{dt} = H_i \left( g_i \cdot \frac{R}{R + h_i} \right) + \sum_j \alpha_{ij} H_j
$$

## Predator Dynamics

$$\frac{dP_k}{dt} = C_k \cdot P_k \left( e_k \cdot \sum_i d_{ik} H_i \right) + \sum_j \beta_{kj} P_j$$

## Interaction Strengths

- **Predator**:

  $$\alpha_{ij} d_i = A_{ij} \sim |N(0, \sigma)|$$

- **Prey**:

  $$-A_{ij}$$

## Equilibrium Conditions

### Resources

$$0 = \text{NPP} - \sum_i c_i X_i$$

### Herbivores

$$0 = X_i \left( g_i \cdot \frac{R}{R + h_i} \right) + \sum_j \alpha_{ij} X_j$$

$$X_i^* = \frac{g_i R^*}{R^* + h_i}$$

where

$$R^* = \frac{\text{NPP}}{\sum_i c_i}$$

### Predators

# New Model Equations

## Resource Dynamics

$$\frac{dR}{dt} = \text{NPP} - l R - a R H$$

- \( \frac{dR}{dt} \): Rate of change of resource biomass over time.
- \( \text{NPP} \): Net Primary Productivity.

## Generalization to Multiple Herbivores

### Resource Dynamics

- \( a_i \): Attack rate of herbivore species \( i \).

Solving for \( R^* \):

$$R^* = \frac{\text{NPP}}{l + \sum_{i} a_i H_i^*}$$

### Herbivore Equilibrium

$$0 = \epsilon_i a_i R^* H_i^* - d_i {H_i^*}^2 - \sum_{j} b_j H_i^* P_j^*$$

### Predator Equilibrium

$$0 = \epsilon'_j b_j \sum_{i} H_i^* P_j^* - m_j P_j^*$$

# Equilibrium Analysis of the Resource-Herbivore Model

We consider a simple ecological model with one herbivore species and no predators. The dynamics are given by the following differential equations:

## Model Equations

**Resource Dynamics:**

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \text{NPP} - l R - a R H
$$

- $\text{NPP}$: Net Primary Productivity.
- $l$: Leaching rate (resource loss rate).
- $a$: Attack rate (herbivore's consumption rate of the resource).
- $R$: Resource biomass.
- $H$: Herbivore biomass.

**Herbivore Dynamics:**

$$
\frac{dH}{dt} = \epsilon a R H - d H^2
$$

- $\epsilon$: Assimilation efficiency.
- $d$: Density-dependent mortality rate of the herbivore.

## Equilibrium Conditions

At equilibrium ($\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$ and $\frac{dH}{dt} = 0$), we have:

### Resource Equilibrium

Set $\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$:

$$
0 = \text{NPP} - l R^* - a R^* H^*
$$

Solving for $R^*$:

$$
l R^* + a R^* H^* = \text{NPP}
$$

$$
R^* (l + a H^*) = \text{NPP}
$$

$$
R^* = \frac{\text{NPP}}{l + a H^*}
$$

### Herbivore Equilibrium

Set $\frac{dH}{dt} = 0$:

$$
0 = \epsilon a R^* H^* - d H^{*2}
$$

Assuming $H^* \neq 0$:

$$
\epsilon a R^* - d H^* = 0
$$

Substitute $R^* = \dfrac{\text{NPP}}{l + a H^*}$ into the equation:

$$
\epsilon a \left( \frac{\text{NPP}}{l + a H^*} \right) - d H^* = 0
$$

Simplify:

$$
d a H^{*2} + d l H^* - \epsilon a \text{NPP} = 0
$$

## Solving the Quadratic Equation


$$
H^* = \frac{ - l \pm \sqrt{ l^2 + \dfrac{4 a^2 \epsilon \text{NPP}}{d} } }{ 2 a }
$$

### The Biologically Relevant Solution

Since $l > 0$ and the square root is greater than $l$, the negative root yields a negative $H^*$, which is not biologically meaningful. Therefore, we take the positive root:

$$
H^* = \frac{ - l + \sqrt{ l^2 + \dfrac{4 a^2 \epsilon \text{NPP}}{d} } }{ 2 a }
$$

## Interpretation of the Equilibrium Results

### Equilibrium Herbivore Biomass ($H^*$)

**Dependence on Net Primary Productivity ($\text{NPP}$):**

- As $\text{NPP}$ increases, the term under the square root increases, leading to a higher $H^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** Higher resource input supports larger herbivore populations.

**Effect of Assimilation Efficiency ($\epsilon$):**

- Higher $\epsilon$ increases the term under the square root, leading to a higher $H^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** Herbivores that convert consumed resources more efficiently can sustain higher populations.

**Impact of Mortality Rate ($d$):**

- Higher $d$ reduces the term $\dfrac{4 a^2 \epsilon \text{NPP}}{d}$, decreasing $H^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** Higher mortality reduces herbivore biomass.

**Role of Attack Rate ($a$):**

- Higher $a$ increases the term under the square root, leading to a higher $H^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** Herbivores that consume resources more effectively can sustain higher populations.

**Effect of Leaching Rate ($l$):**

- $l$ appears negatively in the numerator and within the square root.
- **Biological Meaning:** Higher resource loss can reduce $H^*$, but the overall effect depends on the balance with other parameters.

### Equilibrium Resource Biomass ($R^*$)

**Dependence on $\text{NPP}$:**

- Direct proportionality: Higher $\text{NPP}$ increases $R^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** More resource input leads to higher resource availability unless consumed by herbivores.

**Herbivore Biomass ($H^*$):**

- Inverse relationship: Higher $H^*$ increases $a H^*$, reducing $R^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** Greater herbivore populations consume more resources, decreasing resource biomass.

**Leaching Rate ($l$):**

- Inverse relationship: Higher $l$ increases the denominator, reducing $R^*$.
- **Biological Meaning:** More resource loss through leaching decreases resource availability.

### Conditions for Population Persistence

- **Herbivores Persist ($H^* > 0$)** when the term under the square root is sufficient to make $H^*$ positive.
- **Resource and Herbivore Balance:** The system reaches equilibrium when resource input and losses balance with herbivore consumption and mortality.

## Biological Implications

1. **Resource Limitation and Carrying Capacity:**

   - The resource level sets an upper limit on herbivore biomass. If resources are abundant (high $\text{NPP}$), herbivores can reach higher population sizes.

2. **Efficiency and Energy Transfer:**

   - **Assimilation Efficiency ($\epsilon$)** is critical for herbivore success. Higher efficiency means more energy is converted into biomass, supporting larger populations.

3. **Mortality and Population Control:**

   - **Density-Dependent Mortality ($d H^2$)** regulates herbivore populations, preventing overexploitation of resources.

4. **Leaching and Ecosystem Productivity:**

   - **Leaching Rate ($l$)** represents resource losses that are not available to herbivores. Managing these losses can enhance ecosystem productivity.
