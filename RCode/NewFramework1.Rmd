# Introduction

This document explains the derivation of a model for herbivore dynamics and its extension to include predators. The approach starts from basic Lotka–Volterra dynamics and incorporates observations of net primary productivity (NPP) and herbivore abundances. We then introduce allometric scaling for growth rates and finally account for predation by incorporating predator dynamics. The aim is to link model parameters directly to measurable quantities.

# 1. Model without predators

## 1.1 NPP and herbivore equilibrium

The starting hypothesis is that at equilibrium, net primary productivity (NPP) is balanced by the growth of the herbivore populations. In other words, given observed herbivore abundances \( H_i^{\text{obs}} \) and intrinsic growth rates \( g_i \), we assume:

$$
\text{NPP} \approx \sum_i g_i\, H_i^{\text{obs}}
$$

## 1.2 The basic herbivore dynamics

We start with a Lotka–Volterra type model for herbivores:
$$
\dot{H}_i = \left( g_i - m_i - d_i\left( H_i + \sum_{j \neq i} \mu_{ij} H_j \right) \right) H_i
$$
where:

- \( g_i \) is the intrinsic growth rate (directly related to NPP),

- \( m_i \) is the natural mortality rate,

- \( d_i \) is the coefficient of intraspecific competition,

- \( d_i \mu_{ij} \) represents interspecific competition.

## 1.3 Factoring out the net rate

It is useful to factor out the net intrinsic rate \( g_i - m_i \) from the model. This gives:
$$
\dot{H}_i = (g_i - m_i) \left[ 1 - \frac{d_i\left( H_i + \sum_{j\neq i} \mu_{ij}H_j \right)}{\mathcal{H}_i} \right] H_i
$$
An artificial parameter is then introduced:
$$
\mathcal{H}_i = \frac{g_i - m_i}{d_i}
$$
which can be thought of as a reference density for species \( i \).

## 1.4 Introducing the niche parameter

Next, a niche parameter \(\beta_i\) is defined as:
$$
\beta_i = \frac{g_i}{m_i} - 1
$$
which is positive when the species persists. This parameter captures the advantage that the environment confers on species \( i \).

With this definition, the herbivore model can be rewritten as:
$$
\dot{H}_i = g_i\, \frac{\beta_i}{1+\beta_i} \left[ 1 - \frac{H_i + \sum_{j\neq i}\mu_{ij}H_j}{H_i^{\text{obs}}(\mu)} \right] H_i
$$
where the effective observed abundance is defined as:
$$
H_i^{\text{obs}}(\mu) = H_i^{\text{obs}} + \sum_{j\neq i}\mu_{ij}H_j^{\text{obs}}
$$
This correction accounts for the effect of interspecific competition on the observed densities.

## 1.5 Allometric scaling of the growth rate

The growth rate \( g_i \) is assumed to scale with body size through an allometric relation:
$$
g_i = M_i^{-\alpha} x_i
$$
where:

- \( M_i \) is a measure of the body size of species \( i \),

- \(\alpha\) is the allometric exponent,

- \( x_i \) is a scaling factor adjusted to meet the NPP constraint.

To satisfy the overall NPP, we impose:
$$
\text{NPP} = \sum_i x_i\, M_i^{-\alpha}\, H_i^{\text{obs}}
$$
and a possible solution for \( x_i \) is:
$$
x_i = \frac{\text{NPP}\, M_i^{-\alpha}\, H_i^{\text{obs}}}{\| M^{-\alpha} H^{\text{obs}} \|^2}
$$
Then the effective growth rate becomes:
$$
g_i^{\text{obs}}(\text{NPP}) = \frac{\text{NPP}\, M_i^{-2\alpha}\, H_i^{\text{obs}}}{\| M^{-\alpha} H^{\text{obs}} \|^2}
$$

Thus, the herbivore dynamics (without predators) can be expressed as:
$$
\dot{H}_i = g_i^{\text{obs}}(\text{NPP})\, \frac{\beta_i}{1+\beta_i} \left[ 1 - \frac{H_i + \sum_{j\neq i}\mu_{ij}H_j}{H_i^{\text{obs}}(\mu)} \right] H_i
$$

# 2. Extending the model: inclusion of predators

## 2.1 Adding predation to herbivore mortality

In the presence of predators, the herbivore mortality is increased by predation. The mortality term is modified as:
$$
m_i \to m_i + \sum_\alpha a_{\alpha i} P_\alpha
$$
where:

- \( a_{\alpha i} \) is the attack rate of predator \(\alpha\) on herbivore \(i\),

- \( P_\alpha \) is the density of predator \(\alpha\).

It is useful to nondimensionalize the attack rate by defining:
$$
A^*_{i\alpha} = \frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}
$$

## 2.2 Predator dynamics

Predators are assumed to follow Lotka–Volterra dynamics. The basic predator model is given by:
$$
\dot{P}_\alpha = \left[ \epsilon \sum_i a_{\alpha i} H_i - m_\alpha - d_\alpha P_\alpha - \sum_\beta b_{\alpha\beta} P_\beta \right] P_\alpha
$$
with:

- \(\epsilon < 1\) as the trophic efficiency,

- \( m_\alpha \) as the predator mortality,

- \( d_\alpha \) as self-regulation,

- \( b_{\alpha\beta} \) encoding predator–predator interactions.


An overpopulation threshold is introduced:
$$
P_{\alpha 0} = \frac{m_\alpha}{d_\alpha}
$$
Furthermore, define nondimensional parameters:
$$
B_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{b_{\alpha\beta}}{d_\alpha} \quad \text{and} \quad A_{\alpha i} = \frac{\epsilon\, a_{\alpha i}}{d_\alpha}
$$
The predator dynamics can then be rewritten in nondimensional form as:
$$
\dot{P}_\alpha = m_\alpha \left[ \frac{\sum_i A_{\alpha i} H_i - P_{\alpha 0} - \sum_\beta B_{\alpha\beta} P_\beta}{P_{\alpha 0}} \right] P_\alpha
$$

## 2.3 Redefining the observed herbivore abundance

With predators affecting herbivore mortality, we must update the effective observed herbivore density. The modified observed abundance is defined as:
$$
H_i^{\text{obs}}(\mu, C, G) = H_i^{\text{obs}} + \sum_{j\neq i}\mu_{ij}H_j^{\text{obs}} + \sum_\alpha A^*_{i\alpha} P_\alpha^{\text{obs}}
$$
This expression now accounts for:

- The original observed herbivore density,

- The effect of interspecific competition,

- The additional reduction due to predation (through \( A^*_{i\alpha} \) and the observed predator densities).

## 2.4 Updated herbivore dynamics with predation

The herbivore dynamics now become:
$$
\dot{H}_i = g_i^{\text{obs}}(\text{NPP})\, \frac{\beta_i}{1+\beta_i} \left[ 1 - \frac{H_i + \sum_{j\neq i}\mu_{ij} H_j + \sum_\alpha A^*_{i\alpha} P_\alpha}{H_i^{\text{obs}}(\mu, C, G)} \right] H_i
$$
This formulation explicitly includes both competitive and predatory effects on the herbivores.

## 2.5 Equilibrium and linking to apparent competition

At equilibrium, the predator densities \( P_\alpha^* \) can be expressed as:
$$
P_\alpha^* = \sum_i \sum_\beta B^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} A_{\beta i} H_i - \sum_\beta B^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} P_{0\beta}
$$
Consequently, one shows that:

$$
\sum_\alpha A^*_{i\alpha} P_\alpha^* = \sum_j \left( \sum_{\alpha,\beta} A^*_{i\alpha} B^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} A_{\beta j} \right) H_j - \left( \sum_{\alpha,\beta} A^*_{i\alpha} B^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} P_{0\beta} \right)
$$
In the above expression, the term

$$
\sum_{\alpha,\beta} A^*_{i\alpha} B^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} A_{\beta j}
$$
can be interpreted as the "apparent competition" \( C_{ij} \), and the offset term

$$
\sum_{\alpha,\beta} A^*_{i\alpha} B^{-1}_{\alpha\beta} P_{0\beta}
$$
relates to predator release \( G_i \). Under the equilibrium assumption, the net effect of predation can then be incorporated into the model as:

$$
\sum_\alpha A^*_{i\alpha} P_\alpha^{\text{obs}} = \sum_j C_{ij} H_j - G_i
$$

## 2.6 Holling type II functional response for predators

In the basic predator dynamics (Section 2.2), the feeding term is originally represented as:

$$
\text{attack\_sum}_\alpha = \sum_i A_{\alpha i} H_i
$$

where \( A_{\alpha i} \) represents the effective attack rate of predator \( \alpha \) on prey \( i \), and \( H_i \) is the density of prey species \( i \).

To account for the saturation of predator consumption at high prey densities, we incorporate the Holling type II functional response. For a single predator–prey interaction, the classical form is given by:

$$
f(H) = \frac{aH}{1 + ahH}
$$

where:

- \( a \) is the attack rate,

- \( h \) is the handling time,

- \( H \) is the prey density.

In our multi-prey context, we first define the total encounter rate for predator \( \alpha \) as:

$$
\text{attack\_sum}_\alpha = \sum_i A_{\alpha i} H_i
$$

Introducing the handling time \( h \), the Holling type II response becomes:

$$
\text{sat\_attack}_\alpha = \frac{\text{attack\_sum}_\alpha}{1 + h\,\text{attack\_sum}_\alpha}
$$

This formulation exhibits two key features:

- **At low prey densities:** When \( h\,\text{attack\_sum}_\alpha \ll 1 \), we have \( \text{sat\_attack}_\alpha \approx \text{attack\_sum}_\alpha \), recovering the linear response.

- **At high prey densities:** The denominator increases, causing the consumption rate to saturate, which reflects the predator’s limited capacity to process prey.

Thus, the predator dynamics incorporating the Holling type II functional response are expressed as:

$$
\dot{P}_\alpha = P_\alpha\, m_\alpha \left( \frac{\text{sat\_attack}_\alpha - P_{0\alpha} - \sum_{\beta} B_{\alpha\beta} P_\beta}{P_{0\alpha}} \right)
$$
