# Bipartite model equations

## Herbivore dynamics

$$
\frac{d H_i}{dt} = g_i H_i \left( 1 - \frac{H_i + \sum_j \mu_{ij} H_j + \sum_{\alpha} A_{i\alpha}^{*} P_{\alpha}}{\mathcal{H}_i} \right)
$$

## Predator dynamics

$$
\frac{d P_{\alpha}}{dt} = m_\alpha P_{\alpha} 
\left( \frac{\sum_i A_{\alpha i} H_i - P_{\alpha} + \sum_{\beta} B_{\alpha \beta} P_{\beta}}{P_{\alpha}^{0}} - 1 \right)
$$

## Scaling of attack rates

Two key scaling relationships adjust raw attack rates:

$$
A_{\alpha i} = \varepsilon\left( \frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_\alpha} \right) \quad \text{and} \quad A_{\alpha i}^{*} = \frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}.
$$

## Reference predator density

$$
\hat{P}_{\alpha} = \sum_i A_{\alpha i} H_i^* - P_{\alpha}^{(0)} \quad ; \quad P_{\alpha}^{(0)} = \frac{m_{\alpha}}{d_{\alpha}}
$$

- **\(\hat{P}_{\alpha}\)** represents the fixed predator \(\alpha\) abundance when we fix the equilibrium herbivore densities \(H_i^*\). It is the difference between the resource gains from preying on herbivores and the \(P_{\alpha}^{(0)}\) threshold.
  
- **\(P_{\alpha}^{(0)}\)** this threshold, given by the ratio \(\frac{m_{\alpha}}{d_{\alpha}}\), is the density at which density-dependent effects overcome mortality effects.

# Predator-Predator interaction case

In this case, predators interact trophically with one another. The equilibrium predator density is given by

$$
P^* = (1 - B)^{-1} \hat{P},
$$

which expands as

$$
P^* = \hat{P} + B\,\hat{P} + B^2\,\hat{P} + \dots.
$$

- The inverse \((1-B)^{-1}\) indicates that even small base inputs \(\hat{P}\) can be amplified through repeated trophic interactions. The series expansion makes this amplification explicit.
  
- **Alternate formulation:**  
  An alternate expression is given by
  $$
  \hat{P}_{\alpha} = A\, H_{prey,\alpha}^* - P_{\alpha}^{(0)}
  $$
  where \(H_{prey,\alpha}^*\) is the equilibrium abundance of the prey that predator \(\alpha\) feeds on, and
  $$
  A = \frac{P_{\alpha}^* + P_{\alpha}^{(0)}}{H_{prey,\alpha}^*}
  $$
  This relates the effective resource intake to the available prey biomass.

## Constraints

To ensure that all predators can survive, the model must impose a critical condition on \(A\):

$$
P_\alpha^{(0)} = A\, H_{prey,\alpha}^* - P_\alpha^* \quad \text{(with } A > 0\text{)}
$$

Additionally, we define a critical value \(A_C\) as

$$
A_C^\alpha = \frac{P_{\alpha}^*}{H_{prey,\alpha}^*} \quad \text{and} \quad A_C = \max_\alpha A_C^\alpha.
$$

**Critical \(A_C\):**  
  \(A_C\) is the maximum among the minimum viable attack rates needed for each predator. It sets a threshold such that the uniform attack rate \(A\) must be larger than \(A_C\) to ensure that every predator obtains enough resources to survive.
  
## Mean-Field competition

Herbivore dynamics include a mean-field competition component:

$$
\sum_j \mu_{ij} H_j = \mu H_{\text{TOT}} - \mu H_i.
$$

To allow for omnivory, the herbivore equilibrium is described by:

## Omnivory
$$
H_i = (1-\mu)H_i + \mu\,H_{\text{TOT}} 
- \sum_{j \neq i} O_{ij}^{*} N_j 
+ \sum_{j \neq i} O_{ji} N_j 
- \sum_{\alpha} A_{\alpha i}^{*} P_{\alpha}\,
$$

where

$$
O_{ij}^{*} = \frac{o_{ij}}{d_i}\quad \text{and} \quad O_{ji} = \varepsilon\left(\frac{o_{ji}}{d_j}\right)
$$

and

$$
A_{\alpha i}^{*} = \frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\,
$$

Overall, this equation illustrates that the equilibrium biomass of a herbivore (or omnivore) is determined not only by its intrinsic growth and competition but also by the net effect of predatory interactions: both the benefits of additional resource intake and the costs incurred through predation.

- **Competition/Resource baseline:**  
  The term 
  $$
  (1-\mu)H_i + \mu\,H_{\text{TOT}}
  $$
  captures the intrinsic (self‐regulated) biomass of species \(i\) along with the mean‐field contribution from the total herbivore biomass \(H_{\text{TOT}} = \sum_j H_j\). The parameter \(\mu\) balances these two effects.

- **Herbivore–Herbivore predation (O interactions):**  
  The interactions among herbivores are split into two parts:
  - The loss incurred when species \(i\) is preyed upon by another herbivore \(j\) is given by
    $$
    \sum_{j \neq i} O_{ij}^{*} N_j,
    $$
    where \(O_{ij}^{*} = \frac{o_{ij}}{d_i}\) scales the raw interaction \(o_{ij}\) by the self‐regulation factor of species \(i\).
  - The gain obtained when species \(i\) feeds on another herbivore \(j\) is given by
    $$
    \sum_{j \neq i} O_{ji} N_j,
    $$
    where \(O_{ji} = \varepsilon\left(\frac{o_{ji}}{d_j}\right)\) incorporates the conversion efficiency \(\varepsilon\) and scales the interaction by the attacker’s self‐regulation parameter \(d_j\).
    
- **Scaling of attack rates in omnivory: (correct?)**  
  The effective attack rate for an omnivorous interaction is actually given by
  $$
  O_{i\alpha}^{*} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} O_{\alpha i} \left( \frac{d_{\alpha}}{d_i} \right)
  $$
  which may be further modulated by a factor \((1+x_i)\) to introduce species-specific randomness.

- **Herbivore–Predator interactions (A interactions):**  
  Herbivores do not gain from feeding on predators; they are only subject to losses due to predation. This loss is expressed as
  $$
  \sum_{\alpha} A_{\alpha i}^{*} P_{\alpha},
  $$
  where \(A_{\alpha i}^{*} = \frac{a_{\alpha i}}{d_i}\) is the effective attack rate of predator \(\alpha\) on herbivore \(i\).

# Ecosystem functioning \(\Delta \phi_i\)

To evaluate the contribution of species \(i\) to an ecosystem function \(\phi\), we define:

1. **Direct and indirect contributions:**

$$
\Delta \phi_i = \phi_i + \phi_{/i}\,\bar{a}_i N_i,
$$

where:

- \(\phi_i\) is the direct contribution of species \(i\),

- \(\phi_{/i}\) is the ecosystem function of the community without species \(i\),

- \(\bar{a}_i N_i\) scales the effect of species \(i\)’s abundance \(N_i\) via an average interaction strength \(\bar{a}_i\)**?**

2. **Alternate expression:**

$$
\Delta \phi_i = \phi - \phi_{/i}.
$$

This states that the change in ecosystem function when species \(i\) is removed is simply the difference between the total function \(\phi\) and the function without species \(i\).

3. **Rearrangement:**

Starting with

$$
\Delta \phi_i = \phi_i + (\phi - \Delta \phi_i)\,\bar{a}_i N_i,
$$

we rearrange to obtain

$$
(1 + \bar{a}_i N_i) \Delta \phi_i = \phi_i + \phi\,\bar{a}_i N_i.
$$

4. **Fractional change:**

Dividing by \(\phi\) yields

$$
\frac{\Delta \phi_i}{\phi} = \frac{\frac{\phi_i}{\phi} + \bar{a}_i N_i}{1 + \bar{a}_i N_i}.
$$

- The term \(\frac{\phi_i}{\phi}\) represents the normalized direct contribution.
- \(\bar{a}_i N_i\) captures the indirect effect via abundance**?**
- The denominator \(1+\bar{a}_i N_i\) normalizes the expression**?**

Eventually, abundance \(N_i\) can be transformed using an effect trait \(c_i\) (i.e. \(c_i N_i\)) to reflect functions other than simple biomass.
