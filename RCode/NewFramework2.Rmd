# Herbivore-Only Model Framework

**Relative abundance representation:**  
Let the total observed herbivore biomass be \(H_{TOT}^{obs}\). We represent the biomass of species \(i\) as
$$
H_i^{obs} = H_{TOT}^{obs}\, h_i,
$$
where the vector \(h = (h_1, h_2, \dots, h_{S_H})\) represents the relative abundances and satisfies
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{S_H} h_i = 1.
$$
This normalization makes \(h_i\) directly interpretable as the proportion of the total biomass contributed by species \(i\).

**Linking NPP and growth rates via allometric scaling:**  
Assume that the net primary production (NPP) available to herbivores is used for their growth:
$$
\text{NPP} = \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} g_i H_i = H_{TOT}^{obs} \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} g_i h_i.
$$
Defining the average per-unit biomass growth as
$$
G^{obs} = \frac{\text{NPP}}{H_{TOT}^{obs}} = \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} g_i h_i,
$$
we then postulate that each species’ intrinsic growth rate scales allometrically with its (dimensionless) body mass:
$$
g_i = G_0\, m_i^{-\alpha},
$$
with \(m_i = M_i/M_0\) (i.e. the body mass relative to a reference \(M_0\)) and \(\alpha\) as the allometric exponent. Substituting this into \(G^{obs}\) gives
$$
G^{obs} = G_0 \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} m_i^{-\alpha}\, h_i.
$$
Defining a dimensionless ratio \(R^{obs} = \frac{G^{obs}}{G_0}\), we obtain the key constraint:
$$
\langle m^{-\alpha}, h \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} m_i^{-\alpha}\, h_i = R^{obs}.
$$

**Constraining the relative abundance vector:**  

The model imposes two conditions on \(h\):

1. **Normalization:**  
   $$
   \langle h, 1 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} h_i = 1.
   $$

2. **Growth–Weight constraint:**  
   $$
   \langle m^{-\alpha}, h \rangle = R^{obs}.
   $$

A useful strategy is to decompose \(h\) into a sum of two basis components plus a residual:
$$
h = x\, m^{-\alpha} + y\, 1 + w,
$$
with \(w\) orthogonal to both \(m^{-\alpha}\) and \(1\). Taking inner products yields:
$$
\begin{aligned}
x\, \langle m^{-\alpha}, m^{-\alpha} \rangle + y\, \langle m^{-\alpha}, 1 \rangle &= R^{obs}, \
x\, \langle m^{-\alpha}, 1 \rangle + y\, S_H &= 1.
\end{aligned}
$$
These two equations uniquely determine \(x\) and \(y\), thereby constraining the part of \(h\) that affects both the total biomass and the weighted growth rate.

**Incorporating species-specific deviations:**  
To allow for deviations from the strict allometric scaling, we can modify the growth rate as follows:
$$
g_i = G_0\,(1+\delta q_i)\, m_i^{-\alpha},
$$
where \(\delta q_i\) (or equivalently, \(1+\delta q_i\)) is a species‐specific adjustment factor. This extension lets some species grow faster or slower than the average prediction, thereby adding flexibility to the model. The community-level growth constraint then becomes:
$$
R^{obs} = \sum_{i=1}^{S_H} (1+\delta q_i)\, m_i^{-\alpha}\, h_i.
$$

**Ecological implications:**

- **Normalization (\(\langle h, 1 \rangle = 1\))** ensures that \(h\) represents a valid probability distribution, describing the relative contributions of each species.  

- **Growth–Weighted constraint (\(\langle m^{-\alpha}, h \rangle = R^{obs}\))** forces the community structure to balance the disproportionately large contributions from small species (which have high \(m_i^{-\alpha}\)) with those from larger species.

### **Equation of Fluxes**
$$
NPP = \sum G_i H_i
$$

$$
= H_{tot} \sum G_i h_i
$$

$$
NPP = H_{tot} \langle G \rangle
$$

- **Expectation notation:**  
  $$\langle G \rangle = \sum G_i h_i $$
- **Size-dependent effects?**  
  $$
  G_i = G^{(\alpha)} \left( \frac{B_i}{\bar{B}} \right)^{-\alpha}
  $$

- **Expected value considerations**
  $$
  \langle G \rangle = G^{(\alpha)} \langle g_i^{(\alpha)} \rangle
  $$

- **Question:**

  - *Is \( G^{(\alpha)} \) fixed?*  
    
  - *What explains variance in \( \langle G \rangle \)?*


# Reframing 2
## Equation of Fluxes and Community Structure

We start with the basic flux balance equation:
  
$$
NPP = \sum_{i=1}^{S} G_i\, H_i,
$$

where \(H_i\) is the abundance of species \(i\) and \(G_i\) is its growth rate. Writing the abundances in terms of the total observed biomass \(H_{tot}^{obs}\) and the relative abundance \(h_i\) (so that \(H_i = H_{tot}^{obs} \cdot h_i\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^{S} h_i = 1\)), we have

$$
NPP = H_{tot}^{obs} \sum_{i=1}^{S} G_i\, h_i = H_{tot}^{obs} \langle G \rangle,
$$

with the expectation (or weighted average) defined as

$$
\langle G \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{S} G_i\, h_i.
$$

In our framework, we assume that the individual growth rates depend on species size. In particular, we postulate a scaling law of the form

$$
G_i = G^{(\alpha)} \left(\frac{B_i}{\bar{B}}\right)^{-\alpha},
$$

where \(B_i\) is the body mass (or biomass) of species \(i\), \(\bar{B}\) is a reference value, and \(\alpha\) is the allometric exponent. In many cases, we can also write this scaling relationship more generally as

$$
G_i = G_0 \left(1 + \delta q_i\right) m_i^{-\alpha},
$$

where \(m_i\) is a dimensionless measure of body size (for example, \(m_i = B_i/\bar{B}\)) and \(1+\delta q_i\) accounts for species‐specific deviations from the average scaling law.

Given these relationships, the average growth rate becomes

$$
\langle G \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{S} G_i\, h_i = G^{(\alpha)} \sum_{i=1}^{S} \left(\frac{B_i}{\bar{B}}\right)^{-\alpha} h_i.
$$

Defining the dimensionless ratio

$$
R^{obs} = \frac{G^{obs}}{G^{(\alpha)}} = \sum_{i=1}^{S} m_i^{-\alpha} h_i,
$$

we have a key constraint on the community structure:

1. **Normalization:**

   $$
   \langle h, 1 \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{S} h_i = 1.
   $$

2. **Growth–Weight Constraint:**

   $$
   \langle m^{-\alpha}, h \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{S} m_i^{-\alpha} h_i = R^{obs}.
   $$

These two conditions together force the relative abundance vector \(h\) to take on a structure that reflects both the overall biomass distribution and the size‐dependent growth properties of the species.

### Implications

- **Normalization** guarantees that the \(h_i\) represent true relative contributions to total biomass.

- **Growth–Weight Constraint** implies that species with smaller relative sizes (i.e. lower \(m_i\))—which have higher \(m_i^{-\alpha}\) values—must, on average, have smaller relative abundances \(h_i\) to prevent the weighted sum \(\langle m^{-\alpha}, h \rangle\) from exceeding the observed value \(R^{obs}\). Conversely, larger species can afford to have a higher \(h_i\) since their contribution \(m_i^{-\alpha}\) is lower.

### Exploring the Variance in \(\langle G \rangle\) and the Role of \(\alpha\)

An important question is whether \(G^{(\alpha)}\) can be considered fixed across communities or if its effective value varies. In our framework, the community-level growth is given by

$$
\langle G \rangle = G^{(\alpha)} \langle g_i^{(\alpha)} \rangle,
$$

with

$$
g_i^{(\alpha)} = \left(\frac{B_i}{\bar{B}}\right)^{-\alpha}.
$$

Thus, the variation in \(\langle G \rangle\) is driven by both the distribution of species body sizes (through \(m_i^{-\alpha}\)) and their relative abundances \(h_i\). One way to explore this is by finding the value of \(\alpha\) that minimizes the variation in \(G^{(\alpha)}\) across communities. In other words, if there exists an \(\alpha^*\) such that the predicted ratio

$$
\frac{NPP}{H_{tot}^{obs}} \approx G^{(\alpha^*)} \langle g_i^{(\alpha^*)} \rangle
$$

exhibits minimal variance across different communities, that would support the idea that the allometric framework (with the chosen exponent) can explain the variation in the NPP-to-biomass ratio.

### Summary

By imposing the constraints

- \(\langle h, 1 \rangle = 1\)

- \(\langle m^{-\alpha}, h \rangle = R^{obs}\),

we link the community’s relative species composition directly to size-dependent growth rates. Furthermore, by allowing for a potential deviation term (\(1+\delta q_i\)), we can capture species-specific differences beyond what is predicted solely by body mass. The ultimate goal is to find an optimal \(\alpha\) (and possibly characterize the distribution of \(\delta q_i\)) such that the community-level growth rate is robust across different ecosystems, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed variation in \(NPP/H_{tot}^{obs}\).

Does this explanation capture the idea you’re aiming for?
