Our community model is built upon a generalized Lotka–Volterra framework that explicitly couples net primary production (NPP) with species‐level resource allocation and trophic interactions. For herbivores, population dynamics are governed by

$$
\frac{1}{H_i} \frac{dH_i}{dt} = m_i \left( \left[ \frac{g_i + G_i}{m_i} - 1 \right] - \frac{H_i + \sum_j \left( \mu_{ij} + \dfrac{C_{ij} H_i^0}{m_i} \right) H_j }{H_i^0} \right)
$$

where \( H_i \) represents the density of herbivore species \(i\) and \(m_i\) is its species‐specific mortality rate. The parameter \(H_i^0\) is the characteristic density, defined as
$$
H_i^0 = S \bar{H} h_i
$$

with \(S\) being the total number of herbivore species, \( \bar{H} \) the mean characteristic density, and \(h_i\) a dimensionless niche‐derived scaling factor (with \( \sum_i{h_i}=1 \) ). In our model, the niche of a species—as determined by its position relative to its climatic optimum—is used to define \(h_i\), thereby allowing environmental gradients to affect the inherent abundance of each species.

Resource allocation among species is captured by the vector \(p = (p_i,...., p_s)\). Following an initial species abundance distribution \(\hat{H}\) (which, for herbivores, derives from field‐measured values), an intermediate variable \(\hat{p}_i\) is defined by
$$
\hat{p}_i = \frac{\hat{H}_i + \sum_j M_{ij} \hat{H}_j}{h_i}
$$
The final resource shares are given by normalizing these values \(p_i = \frac{\hat{p}_i}{\sum_j \hat{p}_j}\)

\(M_{ij} = \mu_{ij} + \dfrac{C_{ij} H_i^0}{m_i}\), where \(\mu_{ij}\) represents the baseline interaction (competition) between herbivore species \(i\) and \(j\), and \(\dfrac{C_{ij} H_i^0}{m_i}\) arises from predator effects (apparent competition). Specifically, predation is incorporated by defining
$$
C_{ij} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta}\epsilon a_{i\alpha} A^{-1}_{\alpha\beta}a_{j\beta}
$$
and
$$
G_i = \sum_\beta a_{i\beta}A^{-1}_{\alpha\beta}m_\beta
$$

where \(a_{i\alpha}\) denotes the feeding rate of predator \(\alpha\) on herbivore \(i\), \(\epsilon\) is the predator assimilation efficiency, and \(A\) is the predator interaction matrix (with self-regulation imposed on the diagonal and off-diagonal coefficients reflecting trophic interactions).

In parallel, predator dynamics are modeled according to 
$$
\frac{1}{P_\alpha} \frac{dP_\alpha}{dt} = \epsilon \sum_j a_{j\alpha} H_j - m_\alpha + \sum_{\beta} A_{\alpha\beta} P_\beta
$$


A scaling parameter \(x\) ensures that the total consumption of NPP matches the available resources, with herbivore growth rate determined by
$$
g_i = xp_im_i
$$

and the NPP balance approximated by
$$
\text{NPP} \approx \sum_i g_i H_i \approx x^2 \bar{H} \bar{M} \langle p | \tilde{V} p \rangle
$$


where \(\tilde{V}_{ij} = S q_i V_{ij} S h_j\) and \(V\) is a matrix arising from the inversion of \((I+M)\), with \(q_i\) similarly defined for mortality scaling. For a more complete derivation and discussion of the scaling relationships, including the adjustment of \(x\) to ensure NPP conservation, see the Supplementary Information.

In our framework, some key parameters are treated as free parameters: the average competitive strength \(\mu\); the predation coefficients \(a_{i\alpha}\); and the predator assimilation efficiency \(\epsilon\). Other parameters, such as the resource allocation fractions \(p_i\) and the characteristic densities  (\(H_i^0\), determined via the niche-derived scaling factors \(h_i\)), are derived from pseudoempirical abundance distributions and sdm-derived niches, respectively. Additionally, species-specific mortality rates \(m_i\) and \(m_{\alpha}\) are assumed constant at \(M_{mean}\). Together these parameters govern the balance between resource uptake, intra- and interspecific interactions, and trophic transfers, and are calibrated such that the simulated community attains stable coexistence.
