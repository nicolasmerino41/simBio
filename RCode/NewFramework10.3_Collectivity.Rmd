## Spectral radius \(\phi\) as a collectivity metric  
Compute  

$$
  \phi \;=\;\max\bigl| \lambda (A^*)\bigr|
$$  

for the non‐dimensionalized interaction matrix \(A^*\).

- If \(\phi<1\), indirect effects decay rapidly; if \(\phi\ge1\), long‐loop feedbacks dominate.  

## Empirical signatures of collectivity  
1. **Perturbation depth**: average graph‐distance reached by single‐species removals.  
2. **Temporal unpredictability**:  
   $$
     1 - corr\bigl(\text{early response},\,\text{late response}\bigr)
   $$  
   to a pulse perturbation.  
3. **Biotic‐niche contribution**:  
   $$
     \frac{\sum_i\bigl|N_i/K_i - 1\bigr|^2}{\sum_i\,(N_i/K_i)^2}
   $$  
   measures how much equilibrium abundances deviate from mono‐culture expectations.  

## Relation to May’s complexity (C)  
Let  
$$
  C = \sigma\,\sqrt{p\,(S-1)},
$$  
with \(\sigma^2=\text{Var}(A_{ij})\) and connectance \(p\). Then

- **Lower bound**: \(\phi \ge C\).  

- **Upper bound**: \(\phi \le C\,\sqrt{S-1}\).  

Random webs sit near \(\phi\approx C\); structured webs shift \(\phi\) away from that baseline.  

## Collectivity vs. stability  

- **Stability**: \(\Re(\lambda_{\max}(J))<0\).  

- **Collectivity**: \(\phi\) large \(\Rightarrow\) widespread indirect feedbacks.  

They need not coincide—track both \(\phi\) and the dominant Jacobian eigenvalue.  

## Next steps in our ladder analysis  

- Compute \(\phi\) and \(C\) at each simplification step and monitor their gap.  

- Measure perturbation depth, temporal unpredictability, and biotic‐niche index per step.  

- Overlay \(\phi\) vs.\ \(C\) to diagnose when and why structural integration is lost.
