**Why we see these results?**  

In our trophic model, the Jacobian at equilibrium splits neatly into a diagonal matrix **D** (encoding each species’ self‐regulation) and an off‐diagonal interaction part **M**:

$$
J \;=\; D\,M,
\quad
D = \mathrm{diag}(d_1,\dots,d_S),
\quad
M = -I + A^*,
$$

where for each species 

$$
d_i = 
\begin{cases}
\tfrac{r_i}{K_i}\,B_i^* & \text{(resource)}\\
\tfrac{m_i}{\xi_i}\,B_i^* & \text{(consumer).}
\end{cases}
$$  

When interaction strengths are moderate—so that the typical off‐diagonal magnitude $\sigma=\mathrm{std}(M_{ij})$ is much smaller than the smallest $d_i$—**first‐order perturbation theory** shows the leading eigenvalue of $J=-D+\sigma G$ shifts by

$$
\Delta\lambda \approx \sigma\,G_{ii} \approx 0
$$

in expectation.  Thus the most unstable eigenvalue (governing resilience, return‐times, reactivity, etc.) is set almost entirely by the **diagonals** $d_i$.  Randomizing or erasing $A$ (our ladder steps 9–11) leaves $D$ unchanged, so **community‐level metrics forget the network**.

**When network structure does matter?**

If interaction scale grows so that
$$
\sigma \sim \min_i d_i,
$$

the $O(\sigma)$ corrections no longer vanish and off‐diagonals begin to shift the leading eigenvalue.  Ecologically, **very strong** competition or predation restores a network imprint on resilience and return‐times.  Similarly, metrics probing non‐local dynamics (multistability, cycles, stochastic variance) will re‐inject network effects.

**The special role of Self-Regulation Loss (SL)**  

For each species,
$$
\mathrm{SL}_i \;=\; \frac{B^*_i}{K_i}
$$

measures its realized equilibrium relative to its monoculture carrying capacity.  Since

$$
\mathbf B^* = (I - A)^{-1}\,\mathbf K
         = \bigl(I + A + A^2 + \cdots\bigr)\,\mathbf K,
$$

SL$_i$ depends on **all orders** of $A$.  Even after randomizing $A$, recalculating $B^*$ via the Neumann series ensures SL$_i$ remains **first‐order sensitive** to the exact interaction pattern.  In contrast, bulk metrics hinge only on $D$.

**How to prove it formally**  

1. **Eigenvalue perturbation**  
  - Write $J=-D+\sigma G$, with $G$ zero‐mean.  Use standard matrix perturbation to show  
     $$\lambda_{\max}(J) = -\min_i d_i + O(\sigma^2/\Delta d).$$  

2. **Neumann‐series expansion**  
  - Expand $(I-A)^{-1}=\sum_{n\ge0}A^n$ to express  
     $$\frac{B^*_i}{K_i} = 1 + \sum_jA_{ij}\frac{K_j}{K_i} + O(\sigma^2).$$  
  - Show that randomizing $A$ alters the first‐order term in SL$_i$ but only second‐order in resilience.  
  
**Implications**  
  
  - **Predicting return‐times**: measure each species’ demography ($r_i,K_i,m_i,\xi_i,B_i^*$) and you can forecast bulk stability without mapping the full network.  

  - **Mapping coexistence**: to know *which* species are suppressed or facilitated, you must recover SL$_i$ via the full interaction matrix.  

  - **Threshold of network relevance**: by tuning interaction strength or connectance until $\sigma\approx\min d_i$, you can pinpoint when network architecture reclaims control over community dynamics.
